# RespondingApp

Making responding to (long) messages better.

## Features

### Side-by-Side Authoring

Write your response to a message without the annoyance of having to switch to another app and back again. See your message and response side-by-side for easy line-by-line answering. You'll never forget a part of a friend or client's email again!

### Different Recipients

With version 1.1, you can now keep track of message-response pairs to different people.

## HELP!

### I can't use the return key to add newlines.

It's a problem that's in my to-do list. For now, you can use `Enter` (`Opt-Return`).

### How do I add a new recipient?

Click on the pop-up button next to "Names". Select "New...", enter the new name and begin! Remember to save!

### Ooh! Ooh! I want to know _all_ you've done so far. Where's the changelog?

[Right here](https://github.com/parkr/Responding/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)!

### My question isn't here and I need help!

No problemo. Email me and I'll get back to you asap.
